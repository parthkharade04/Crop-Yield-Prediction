# Crop-Yield-Prediction
This project is performed in R language
Created a Machine Learning Model which predicts the growth of the crop in that area.
It predicts the growth of the crop considering various factors like rainfall, soil type and its Ph value, humidity, temperature and season.
There is crop_prediction.csv file which was combined with the help of 8 other csv files
One main R source file is there which will tell the yield of the crop
